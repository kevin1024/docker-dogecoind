wow

such container

# Usage
Clone the repo and then:

```
docker build .
```

This will compile dogecoind.  Keep in mind that compiling dogecoind uses *lots* of memory, so you might want to [set up a swap file](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/swap#Swap_file_creation) or something first if you are on a memory-constricted server/VPS
